Playdoh
=======

**Mozilla's Playdoh** is a web application **template** based on Django_.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. Playdoh is simply a pre-configured Django project
that adds some essential modules and middleware to meet the following goals:

* Enhance the **security** of your application and its data
* Achieve optimal **performance** in the face of high traffic
* **Localize** content in multiple languages using `Mozilla's L10n standards`_
* Use the best tools and best practices to make development **fun and easy**

This is an open source project; patches are welcome! Feel free to fork and
contribute to this project on Github_.

All new `web development`_ projects at Mozilla (and maybe elsewhere?) are
created using Playdoh. However, Playdoh is not a framework itself. All of its
components can be installed and configured individually without using the
Playdoh template.
